# Software Development Projects
Thanks for checking out my portfolio of data science projects. Below you'll find summaries and links to the repositories of some of the various projects I've completed using Java, Python, React, SQL and HTML/CSS/Javascript. 

## Contents
* Python
  * [Asteroids](https://github.com/leighwest/Asteroids): A modern remake of the arcade classic Asteroids, hosted on a browser-based Python interpreter. This game is hosted on CodeSkulptor, a web-based Python Interpreter. To view the source code and play the game, click [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user48_CJ1QctTrq9_4.py). The game can be launched by clicking the play icon in the top left corner. Alternatively, you can view a 90 second summary video I produced [here](https://vimeo.com/509641149).

* Java
  * [Notes](https://github.com/leighwest/Notes): A JavaFx program which allows users to write, store, retrieve and update notes. While this is a relatively simple application from the user's perspective, my intention when building this application was to integrate CI/CD tools including Gradle, Artifactory, Jenkins and Jacoco. Persistent storage of notes is also achieved by saving all data to a MySQL database.  I don't have a live version of the app available, but you can follow the installation instructions detailed in the readme.md available in the repository or alternatively view a two minute summary video which I produced [here](https://vimeo.com/509638637).

* React
  * [Jammming](https://github.com/leighwest/Jammming): A React.js web application which utilises the Spotify developer API and enables users to search for songs and create and save playlists which are available in their Spotify account.
  * [Cocktails](https://github.com/leighwest/SQL-Querying-Demo/blob/master/Cocktails): A React.js web application which utilises [The CocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) developer API and enables users to search for cocktails and view their recipe. You can view a live version of the app [here](https://leigh-west-cocktails.web.app/). I've also produced a short summary video highlighting the user and technical details available [here](https://vimeo.com/508677668).

* HTML/CSS/Javascript
  * [Personal Website](https://github.com/leighwest/Personal-Website): A personal website hosted at [leighwest.dev](https://www.leighwest.dev) which I created to summarise my skills and showcase some of the projects I have created.

* SQL
  * [Querying an Online Record Store](https://github.com/leighwest/SQL-Querying-Demo/blob/master/Chinook.ipynb): A Jupyter notebook of complex SQL queries with a Python front end which queries the popular Chinook online record store database.  An image file of the scheme diagram is available [here](https://github.com/leighwest/SQL-Querying-Demo/blob/master/Schema.PNG).
